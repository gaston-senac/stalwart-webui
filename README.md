## About this fork

This is a community fork of [stalwartlabs/webui](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/webui) maintained by [LinkPhoenix](https://github.com/LinkPhoenix), focused on UI/UX improvements: mobile-friendly layouts, dark mode polish, additional color themes, a command palette, a calendar date/time picker, and several list/form refinements. Several of these have already been contributed back and shipped in official Stalwart WebUI releases.

**Stalwart WebUI** is a schema-driven single-page application for administering [Stalwart](https://stalw.art). After authentication the panel fetches a JSON schema from the server and dynamically generates all forms, lists, navigation, and layouts from that schema — the schema is the single source of truth, not the UI code.

This fork tries to stay aligned with that philosophy: any AI agent or contributor working on it follows the rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and the small number of deliberate exceptions where the UI does something the official schema doesn't (yet) support are tracked, with the ideal server-side fix for each, in [SCHEMA_DEVIATIONS.md](SCHEMA_DEVIATIONS.md).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of changes in this fork.

Official Stalwart repositories:

- [stalwartlabs/stalwart](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart) — the mail server itself.
- [stalwartlabs/webui](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/webui) — the official admin WebUI this project forks.
- [stalwartlabs/cli](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/cli) — `stalwart-cli`, used below to point a server at a WebUI build.

## Features

Key features (shared with upstream):

- **Schema-driven UI**: All forms, lists, and navigation are generated from a JSON schema fetched from `/api/schema` after login. No object types, field names, or layouts are hardcoded.
- **JMAP protocol**: All data operations (queries, creates, updates, deletes, blob uploads) use JMAP (RFC 8620) with method chaining and result references.
- **Permission-aware**: Every button, link, field, and section respects the user's permissions. Elements the user cannot access are hidden.

Additions in this fork:

- **Community Overview**: inventory cards (directory, mail readiness, access & apps, reports) with attention badges for queue backlog, certificate expiry, and report problems — separate from the Enterprise live-metrics Dashboard.
- **Getting Started checklist**: first-run checklist (domain, DKIM, TLS cert, admin account; optional DMARC) with deep links and docs — shown in the sidebar only while required steps remain (no flash on completed installs).
- **Usable on mobile**: admin lists, forms, and the sidebar work on narrow viewports instead of assuming desktop.
- **Selectable color themes** (Stalwart, Ocean, Forest, Violet, Rose, Amber, Teal) with light/dark, square/rounded corners, and **list density** (comfortable / compact).
- **`Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K` command palette** to search pages, form sections, and fields — including Overview / Appearance keywords (`queue`, `theme`, …).
- **In-app Changelog** in the header menu (published versions only; no `[Unreleased]`).
- **Calendar date/time picker** replacing native date inputs, themed for dark mode.
- **Accounts list**: Role and Usage/Quota columns with coloured progress bars, plus a highlight and recalculate hint for stale negative disk-usage values.
- **CSV export** and **bulk Change quota…** on admin lists (Accounts/Groups for quota).
- **Sieve**: Active column on System/User script lists; syntax-highlighted foldable script editor; expand-to-fit on long textareas.
- **Aliases counts**: Accounts, Groups, Domains, and Mailing Lists lists all show an Aliases column.
- **Sortable list columns**: the most relevant column on every list (Accounts, Groups, Domains, Mailing Lists, Roles) can be sorted client-side.
- **Roles list**: Enabled/Disabled Permissions count columns, so you can see a role's scope without opening it.
- **User menu**: current account name/email and an account switcher in the header dropdown, alongside Appearance settings.
- **Mailboxes list**: shown as an indented hierarchy instead of a flat list.
- **Queued messages**: empty/backlog guidance with links to Delivery Trace and Log Entries.
- **Log Entries**: client-side Level/Event filters (“Exact match only”), named presets, optional auto-refresh, and a rate-limited Refresh button.
- **Report lists**: Pass/Quarantine/Reject (DMARC), Successful/Failed Sessions (TLS), Incidents + Feedback Type (ARF); coloured badges when non-zero; **Problems only** toggle.
- **Open in new tab**: sidebar, header menu, list Create/rows, command palette, and Back/Cancel use real links so middle-click and the browser context menu work.

### Community vs Enterprise (this fork)

| Capability | Community / OSS | Enterprise |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Overview inventory + attention badges | Yes | Yes |
| Getting Started checklist | Yes | Yes |
| Directory / reports / queue / logs (schema + JMAP) | Yes (per permissions) | Yes |
| Live-metrics Dashboard, Live Tracing | Locked / hidden | Yes (with permissions) |
| Appearance, Changelog, command palette | Yes | Yes |

Deliberate client workarounds where the official schema cannot express a feature yet are listed in [SCHEMA_DEVIATIONS.md](SCHEMA_DEVIATIONS.md). Merging upstream WebUI: [docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md](docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md).

## Get Started

Stalwart WebUI ships as part of Stalwart Mail Server. To install Stalwart Mail Server on your server, follow the instructions for your platform:

- [Linux / MacOS](https://stalw.art/docs/install/linux)
- [Windows](https://stalw.art/docs/install/windows)
- [Docker](https://stalw.art/docs/install/docker)

All documentation is available at [stalw.art/docs/get-started](https://stalw.art/docs/get-started). Note that a standard Stalwart install ships the **official** WebUI; see [Switching your server to this fork's UI](#switching-your-server-to-this-forks-ui) below to point your server at this fork instead.

## Switching your server to this fork's UI

Stalwart serves its admin UI as a managed `WEBAPP` application, downloaded from a URL you control — switching to this fork (or back to upstream) is a server-side config change, no rebuild or redeploy of Stalwart itself required. This is done with [`stalwart-cli`](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/cli).

On your server:

```
export STALWART_URL=https://subdomain.domain.com
export STALWART_USER='user@domain.com'
export STALWART_PASSWORD='Password'
```

Find the id of your `WEBAPP` application:

```
stalwart-cli query Application
```

Point it at this fork's latest release instead of upstream's:

```
stalwart-cli update Application ID WEBAPP \
  --field https://github.com/LinkPhoenix/stalwart-webui-fork/releases/latest/download/webui.zip
```

Then trigger the update:

```
stalwart-cli create Action/UpdateApps
```

Every tagged release of this fork publishes a `webui.zip` build via CI (see [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml)), so pointing at `releases/latest/download/webui.zip` always fetches the newest tested build. To go back to the official UI, repeat the `update` step with `https://github.com/stalwartlabs/webui/releases/latest/download/webui.zip`.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18 or later
- A running Stalwart instance (for JMAP API calls) — see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for how to spin up a disposable local test server with Docker, no manual Stalwart setup required.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Configuration is done through Vite environment variables. Copy or edit `.env.development` in the project root:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:443
VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=stalwart-webui
VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=
VITE_OAUTH_SCOPES=
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | URL of the Stalwart server. Used for all API requests during development. In production builds (when empty or unset) requests are relative to the current origin. |
| `VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth 2.0 client ID. Defaults to `stalwart-webui`. |
| `VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | When set, skips the OAuth flow entirely and uses this token for all requests. Useful for local development and testing. |
| `VITE_OAUTH_SCOPES` | Optional OAuth scopes. Omitted from the authorization request when empty. |

### Bypassing OAuth for development

Set `VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` to a valid bearer token to skip the login page and go straight to the admin panel:

```
VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-bearer-token-here
```

Against the local test server from [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md), `scripts/dev-token.ps1` / `scripts/dev-token.sh` fetch one for you automatically.

### Running the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite's development server with hot module replacement, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

Run the unit tests (Vitest):

```
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```

## Building for production

```
npm run build
```

This runs the TypeScript compiler followed by Vite's production build. Output
goes to the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```
